Open Source and Open Science are global movements, but most of their material and resources are published in English, meaning non-English speakers face a significant barrier to being part of these movements.  
Publishing multilingual resources can lower these barriers by increasing access to knowledge, which helps democratize access to quality resources, and therefore increases the potential for contributing to software and open science projects.

We’re excited to announce that with the support of the [Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative](/blog/2021/12/20/inclusive-leadership-program/), [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/) and the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/), we have started translating rOpenSci’s material on best practices for software development, code review, and contribution to open source projects into Spanish.
As part of this effort we are also developing guidelines and tools for translating open source resources to a wider audience.


## Language representation

Approximately 64% of Internet content is in English, although only 4.8% of the world's population speaks English as a first language. Language is a cognitive instrument, it is our vehicle for learning and building our world and it is a source of exclusion. If I do not understand the language in which a project, a community, a movement is conducted, I am not allowed to participate.

For this reason, we are embarking on an effort to translate rOpenSci’s material on best practices for software development, code review, and contribution to open source projects beyond the English language starting with Spanish.

## Why Spanish ?

Spanish is the second most-spoken native language in the world. It is also one of the most geographically widespread languages, reaching many countries with Spanish as an official language. 

The Spanish-speaking R Community has been growing and very active in the last years, for example, Latin American R-Ladies are almost 30% of the Global R-Ladies, with 59 chapters sharing first place with anglophone North America. In 2017 several Latin American R-Ladies start with the translations to Spanish of the R-Ladies' Code of Conducts and the Rules and Guidelines. 

The language barrier is why the community co-founded and runs [LatinR](https://latin-r.com/), a regional trilingual (Spanish, Portuguese, and English) conference, and _ConectaR_, a  regional conference with Spanish as the official language.  

In 2018, the R Community in Latin America collectively translated the [R for Data Science (R4DS) book](https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/) to Spanish.  This includes the translation of the package [datos](https://github.com/cienciadedatos/datos) to Spanish and dados to [Portuguese](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dados/index.html), becoming an excellent tool for teaching. From the success of the collective and volunteer translation of R4DS, the community also translated [Teaching Tech Together](http://teachtogether.tech/es/index.html) and contributed to several translations to Spanish of [RStudio CheatSheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/?type=translations/#translation-12), [The Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)’ and [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/es/) lessons. 

Driven by this active and growing spanish-speaking community, rOpenSci [successfully piloted](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/07/27/censo2017/) our first [Spanish-language peer review](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-06-28/), where the submission itself, and all reviews, and editorial responses were in Spanish.

All this work and previous experience generated the right conditions to start this task with Spanish.
